###An typical walk-through example

1.At the beginning of the program, you will see an option list:

![menu1](elements/1.png?raw=true =650x)

2.Choose one you interested in; suppose you want to know the relationship between civil level and base salaries, you could type `d`. Then the scatter-plot will pop up: 

![line plot](elements/2.png?raw=true =650x)

Close the plot window to go back

3.After that, we could also search for jobs by entering a keyword, you should first select `g` to change to a searching mode, then type your keyword, say, "manager". A list of available jobs will displayed on the screen with their job ID and business title:

![list of available jobs](elements/3.png?raw=true =650x)

At the end of this list, you will see a menu showing all the option with which you can explore the job list:

![job list menu](elements/4.png?raw=true =650x)

4.For example, you want to see all these jobs' location on a google map, you can type `m`. Then a map will pop up:

![list map](elements/5.png?raw=true =650x)

Remember to close the image window to move on

5.If you want to get more information about a specific job, select `g`, then as the prompt instrunction says, type a job id of which job you want to learn more. For example, we select the job Id `142484`. It will pop a new menu:

![one job menu](elements/7.png?raw=true =650x)

You can either select a to show the detailed infomation or select b to show its location on the map. If you want go back to the job list and explore other jobs or plot, just input `q` to go back

6.Then you may want to know the percentage of different degree requirment. Then type `a`, a pie plot will pop up:

![pie plot](elements/6.png?raw=true =650x)

7.When you decide to end this program, input `q`. Then the whole program will end.
